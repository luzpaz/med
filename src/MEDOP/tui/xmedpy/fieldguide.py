    """
    In this python console, you manipulate variables that identifies
    field objects. These variables are proxy objects towards the real
    MED fields stored as MEDCoupling instances in the SALOME
    container.

    What you can do with this proxy object:

    - you can manipulate this object in algebric operations (+,-,*,/):
    >>> add = f1 + f2
    >>> dif = f1 - f2
    >>> mul = f1 * f2
    >>> div = f1 / f2 (an exception is raised in case of division by 0)
    >>> square = pow(f1, 2)

    - the operande could be a scalar numerical value:
    >>> offset  = f1 + 4.2
    >>> scaling = 3.8 * f1
    
    - any combination of this operations can be done on a single instruction:
    >>> x = f1 + pow(f2)
    >>> y = f1 + x - f2

    - you can request some helper functions on this object:
    >>> doc      : print the user documentation for field operations
    >>> print f  : print the main properties of the field f (name, values, ...)
    >>> f.dup()  : create a dublicate of the field f
    >>> dup(f)   : do the same thing
    >>> f.visu() : display the modulus of this field using VISU post-processor.
