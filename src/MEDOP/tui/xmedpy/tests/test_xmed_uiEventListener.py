# This script can be used to test the event listener. Note that the
# event listener is a CORBA object created inside the XMED GUI and
# that it could be reached if and only if the XMED GUI is loaded
# first.
#
# Then two tests are defined:
# - First you can try to import and use this script in the python
#   console while the XMED GUI is NOT loaded. Then you will check that
#   the script detects that the event listener is not available.
# - Second you can try to import this script AFTER having load the
#   XMED GUI. Then the test will be completed.
