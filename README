I : Major evolution of the Med Memory package between V2.2.x and V3.2.x :
=========================================================================

The Med Memory may be used as a stand alone package with only the C++ and the
python layers (adding --without-kernel at the configure step). In this case
there are no links with the SALOME KERNEL.

In this version,

- mesh defined with polygones/polyhedra mixed with usual types of cells;

- the Med File drivers of the Med Memory support the V2.1 as well as the
  V2.2 versions of the Med File layer. The requirement of the Salome platform
  is only Med File V2.2, the V2.1 version is emberked in the Med Memory.

- Using the Med file (V2.1 and V2.2) and GIBI drivers; fields laying on a
  partial support;

- Fields defined on cells mesh with multiple gauss points,

may be mounted in memory and treated.

With all those new functionalities, most of the Med Memory client codes
based on previous releases of the Med Memory should work; but minor changes
should be done for the get/set field classes methods:

- the getValue() and the setValue(T *) methods take no MED_EN::medModeSwitch
  parameter;
- the getValueI (resp. setValueI) should be replaced by getRow(int )
  (resp. setRow(int ,T*) if the field is in full interlacing mode (using the
  method getInterlacingType() of the classe FIELD_). If the field is stored in
  no interlacing mode getValueIJ (resp. setValueIJ) should be replaced by
  getColumn(int ) (resp. setColumn(int ,T*)).

Intensive debugging was carried throughout the entire Med Memory C++ Layer:

  - especially on the major user's C++ classes (such as MED, MESH,
    SUPPORT and FIELD);

  - the C++ drivers classes on those major classes. Especially the
    Med File and the GIBI drivers are read/write ones. The VTK drivers
    are only for the writing; and finally the PORFLOW drivers may only
    be used for the MESH class in the reading mode.

The Med Client layer of the Med Memory has been tested in a full
Server/Client configuration.

II : MedMemory building and installation :
=========================================

It's very simple :

./configure --prefix=path_to_your_installation_directory
make
make install

eventually if the user or the installer needs to build an installation of Med
Memory as a stand alone package, he may use the configure option
--without-kernel. By default the full debug options are set:
      - compilation using -g option
      - Med Memory debugging information history using -D_DEBUG_ option.

The user may get all configure option with :
  ./configure --help

The user may set optimization option :
  ./configure --enable-production --disable-debug (use compiler flags -O)

In order to avoid most of the problem the user or the installer should first
check the HDF5HOME and the MED2HOME environment variables. This version of
Med Memory with Med File V2.2.2, V2.2.3, as well as V2.3.0 but with the
version of HDF5 V1.6.3. In the installation of Med File you should take care
of the $HDF5HOME environement variable. This warning is especially intended
to the user of The Med Memory in stand alone (without the SALOME KERNEL
component).

III : MedMemory testing :
=========================

After installation of the Med Memory; the user may find a large set of test
files in Med File V2.1, V2.2, GIBI format.

To check the Med Memory installation, in the directory
path_to_your_installation_directory/bin/salome you may find a set of python
scripts and test executable. To ckeck the deep layers (C++, Python) of the Med
Memory, the installer may run:

- testMedMemGeneral.py,
- medMeshing_test.py
- test_profil_MedFieldDriver.py
- testGaussLocalization.py
- med_field_anal.py
- test_MEDMEM_MeshingFlica
- test_MEDMEM_Meshing_poly
- test_MEDMEM_MeshingPoly

To check the upper layer (CORBA, Client), the installer may run in the SALOME
Python consol:

 - Med_Gen_test.py
 - medClient_test.py
 - testMedAlliances1.py
 - testMedAlliances.py
 - testMeshAlliances.py
